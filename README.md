# BMI Calculator App - Flutter & Riverpod

This is a simple and elegant BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application built using Flutter. The app allows users to input their information and then calculates and displays their BMI. Depending on the calculated BMI value, the app also categorizes the user's weight status (e.g., underweight, normal or overweight).

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for quick and accurate BMI calculation.
- **Weight Status Categorization:** Displays the user's weight category based on their BMI.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both Android and iOS devices.

## BMI Categories

The app uses the following categories to classify BMI:

- **Underweight:** BMI < 18.5
- **Normal weight:** 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
- **Overweight:** 25 ≤ BMI
